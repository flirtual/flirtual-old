rc - a shell
============

This is rc, the Plan 9 shell, reimplemented for Unix by Byron Rakitzis.

The original rc was designed and implemented by Tom Duff at Bell Labs.
It has a small feature set similar to a traditional Bourne shell, but
with a much cleaner and simpler syntax. Among other things, this makes
rc much better than Bourne-compatible shells at handling filenames which
contain spaces. Thus, writing rc scripts is less error-prone than
writing sh scripts.

This reimplementation of rc can be linked with GNU readline, BSD
libedit, or similar line editing libraries, to make a pleasant
interactive shell.
