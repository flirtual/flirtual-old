/// # Format
///
/// This section describes the JSON format used by this printer.
///
/// To skip the rigamarole, take a look at the
/// [example](#example)
/// at the end.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The format of this printer is the [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/)
/// format. Specifically, this printer emits a sequence of messages, where
/// each message is encoded as a single JSON value on a single line. There are
/// four different types of messages (and this number may expand over time):
///
/// * **begin** - A message that indicates a file is being searched.
/// * **end** - A message the indicates a file is done being searched. This
///   message also include summary statistics about the search.
/// * **match** - A message that indicates a match was found. This includes
///   the text and offsets of the match.
/// * **context** - A message that indicates a contextual line was found.
///   This includes the text of the line, along with any match information if
///   the search was inverted.
///
/// Every message is encoded in the same envelope format, which includes a tag
/// indicating the message type along with an object for the payload:
///
/// ```json
/// {
///     "type": "{begin|end|match|context}",
///     "data": { ... }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The message itself is encoded in the envelope's `data` key.
///
/// ## Text encoding
///
/// Before describing each message format, we first must briefly discuss text
/// encoding, since it factors into every type of message. In particular, JSON
/// may only be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32. For the purposes of this
/// printer, we need only worry about UTF-8. The problem here is that searching
/// is not limited to UTF-8 exclusively, which in turn implies that matches
/// may be reported that contain invalid UTF-8. Moreover, this printer may
/// also print file paths, and the encoding of file paths is itself not
/// guarnateed to be valid UTF-8. Therefore, this printer must deal with the
/// presence of invalid UTF-8 somehow. The printer could silently ignore such
/// things completely, or even lossily transcode invalid UTF-8 to valid UTF-8
/// by replacing all invalid sequences with the Unicode replacement character.
/// However, this would prevent consumers of this format from accessing the
/// original data in a non-lossy way.
///
/// Therefore, this printer will emit valid UTF-8 encoded bytes as normal
/// JSON strings and otherwise base64 encode data that isn't valid UTF-8. To
/// communicate whether this process occurs or not, strings are keyed by the
/// name `text` where as arbitrary bytes are keyed by `bytes`.
///
/// For example, when a path is included in a message, it is formatted like so,
/// if and only if the path is valid UTF-8:
///
/// ```json
/// {
///     "path": {
///         "text": "/home/ubuntu/lib.rs"
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If instead our path was `/home/ubuntu/lib\xFF.rs`, where the `\xFF` byte
/// makes it invalid UTF-8, the path would instead be encoded like so:
///
/// ```json
/// {
///     "path": {
///         "bytes": "L2hvbWUvdWJ1bnR1L2xpYv8ucnM="
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This same representation is used for reporting matches as well.
///
/// The printer guarantees that the `text` field is used whenever the
/// underlying bytes are valid UTF-8.
///
/// ## Wire format
///
/// This section documents the wire format emitted by this printer, starting
/// with the four types of messages.
///
/// Each message has its own format, and is contained inside an envelope that
/// indicates the type of message. The envelope has these fields:
///
/// * **type** - A string indicating the type of this message. It may be one
///   of four possible strings: `begin`, `end`, `match` or `context`. This
///   list may expand over time.
/// * **data** - The actual message data. The format of this field depends on
///   the value of `type`. The possible message formats are
///   [`begin`](#message-begin),
///   [`end`](#message-end),
///   [`match`](#message-match),
///   [`context`](#message-context).
///
/// #### Message: **begin**
///
/// This message indicates that a search has begun. It has these fields:
///
/// * **path** - An
///   [arbitrary data object](#object-arbitrary-data)
///   representing the file path corresponding to the search, if one is
///   present. If no file path is available, then this field is `null`.
///
/// #### Message: **end**
///
/// This message indicates that a search has finished. It has these fields:
///
/// * **path** - An
///   [arbitrary data object](#object-arbitrary-data)
///   representing the file path corresponding to the search, if one is
///   present. If no file path is available, then this field is `null`.
/// * **binary_offset** - The absolute offset in the data searched
///   corresponding to the place at which binary data was detected. If no
///   binary data was detected (or if binary detection was disabled), then this
///   field is `null`.
/// * **stats** - A [`stats` object](#object-stats) that contains summary
///   statistics for the previous search.
///
/// #### Message: **match**
///
/// This message indicates that a match has been found. A match generally
/// corresponds to a single line of text, although it may correspond to
/// multiple lines if the search can emit matches over multiple lines. It
/// has these fields:
///
/// * **path** - An
///   [arbitrary data object](#object-arbitrary-data)
///   representing the file path corresponding to the search, if one is
///   present. If no file path is available, then this field is `null`.
/// * **lines** - An
///   [arbitrary data object](#object-arbitrary-data)
///   representing one or more lines contained in this match.
/// * **line_number** - If the searcher has been configured to report line
///   numbers, then this corresponds to the line number of the first line
///   in `lines`. If no line numbers are available, then this is `null`.
/// * **absolute_offset** - The absolute byte offset corresponding to the start
///   of `lines` in the data being searched.
/// * **submatches** - An array of [`submatch` objects](#object-submatch)
///   corresponding to matches in `lines`. The offsets included in each
///   `submatch` correspond to byte offsets into `lines`. (If `lines` is base64
///   encoded, then the byte offsets correspond to the data after base64
///   decoding.) The `submatch` objects are guaranteed to be sorted by their
///   starting offsets. Note that it is possible for this array to be empty,
///   for example, when searching reports inverted matches.
///
/// #### Message: **context**
///
/// This message indicates that a contextual line has been found. A contextual
/// line is a line that doesn't contain a match, but is generally adjacent to
/// a line that does contain a match. The precise way in which contextual lines
/// are reported is determined by the searcher. It has these fields, which are
/// exactly the same fields found in a [`match`](#message-match):
///
/// * **path** - An
///   [arbitrary data object](#object-arbitrary-data)
///   representing the file path corresponding to the search, if one is
///   present. If no file path is available, then this field is `null`.
/// * **lines** - An
///   [arbitrary data object](#object-arbitrary-data)
///   representing one or more lines contained in this context. This includes
///   line terminators, if they're present.
/// * **line_number** - If the searcher has been configured to report line
///   numbers, then this corresponds to the line number of the first line
///   in `lines`. If no line numbers are available, then this is `null`.
/// * **absolute_offset** - The absolute byte offset corresponding to the start
///   of `lines` in the data being searched.
/// * **submatches** - An array of [`submatch` objects](#object-submatch)
///   corresponding to matches in `lines`. The offsets included in each
///   `submatch` correspond to byte offsets into `lines`. (If `lines` is base64
///   encoded, then the byte offsets correspond to the data after base64
///   decoding.) The `submatch` objects are guaranteed to be sorted by
///   their starting offsets. Note that it is possible for this array to be
///   non-empty, for example, when searching reports inverted matches such that
///   the original matcher could match things in the contextual lines.
///
/// #### Object: **submatch**
///
/// This object describes submatches found within `match` or `context`
/// messages. The `start` and `end` fields indicate the half-open interval on
/// which the match occurs (`start` is included, but `end` is not). It is
/// guaranteed that `start <= end`. It has these fields:
///
/// * **match** - An
///   [arbitrary data object](#object-arbitrary-data)
///   corresponding to the text in this submatch.
/// * **start** - A byte offset indicating the start of this match. This offset
///   is generally reported in terms of the parent object's data. For example,
///   the `lines` field in the
///   [`match`](#message-match) or [`context`](#message-context)
///   messages.
/// * **end** - A byte offset indicating the end of this match. This offset
///   is generally reported in terms of the parent object's data. For example,
///   the `lines` field in the
///   [`match`](#message-match) or [`context`](#message-context)
///   messages.
///
/// #### Object: **stats**
///
/// This object is included in messages and contains summary statistics about
/// a search. It has these fields:
///
/// * **elapsed** - A [`duration` object](#object-duration) describing the
///   length of time that elapsed while performing the search.
/// * **searches** - The number of searches that have run. For this printer,
///   this value is always `1`. (Implementations may emit additional message
///   types that use this same `stats` object that represents summary
///   statistics over multiple searches.)
/// * **searches_with_match** - The number of searches that have run that have
///   found at least one match. This is never more than `searches`.
/// * **bytes_searched** - The total number of bytes that have been searched.
/// * **bytes_printed** - The total number of bytes that have been printed.
///   This includes everything emitted by this printer.
/// * **matched_lines** - The total number of lines that participated in a
///   match. When matches may contain multiple lines, then this includes every
///   line that is part of every match.
/// * **matches** - The total number of matches. There may be multiple matches
///   per line. When matches may contain multiple lines, each match is counted
///   only once, regardless of how many lines it spans.
///
/// #### Object: **duration**
///
/// This object includes a few fields for describing a duration. Two of its
/// fields, `secs` and `nanos`, can be combined to give nanosecond precision
/// on systems that support it. It has these fields:
///
/// * **secs** - A whole number of seconds indicating the length of this
///   duration.
/// * **nanos** - A fractional part of this duration represent by nanoseconds.
///   If nanosecond precision isn't supported, then this is typically rounded
///   up to the nearest number of nanoseconds.
/// * **human** - A human readable string describing the length of the
///   duration. The format of the string is itself unspecified.
///
/// #### Object: **arbitrary data**
///
/// This object is used whenever arbitrary data needs to be represented as a
/// JSON value. This object contains two fields, where generally only one of
/// the fields is present:
///
/// * **text** - A normal JSON string that is UTF-8 encoded. This field is
///   populated if and only if the underlying data is valid UTF-8.
/// * **bytes** - A normal JSON string that is a base64 encoding of the
///   underlying bytes.
///
/// More information on the motivation for this representation can be seen in
/// the section [text encoding](#text-encoding) above.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// This section shows a small example that includes all message types.
///
/// Here's the file we want to search, located at `/home/andrew/sherlock`:
///
/// ```text
/// For the Doctor Watsons of this world, as opposed to the Sherlock
/// Holmeses, success in the province of detective work must always
/// be, to a very large extent, the result of luck. Sherlock Holmes
/// can extract a clew from a wisp of straw or a flake of cigar ash;
/// but Doctor Watson has to have it taken out for him and dusted,
/// and exhibited clearly, with a label attached.
/// ```
///
/// Searching for `Watson` with a `before_context` of `1` with line numbers
/// enabled shows something like this using the standard printer:
///
/// ```text
/// sherlock:1:For the Doctor Watsons of this world, as opposed to the Sherlock
/// --
/// sherlock-4-can extract a clew from a wisp of straw or a flake of cigar ash;
/// sherlock:5:but Doctor Watson has to have it taken out for him and dusted,
/// ```
///
/// Here's what the same search looks like using the JSON wire format described
/// above, where in we show semi-prettified JSON (instead of a strict JSON
/// Lines format), for illustrative purposes:
///
/// ```json
/// {
///   "type": "begin",
///   "data": {
///     "path": {"text": "/home/andrew/sherlock"}}
