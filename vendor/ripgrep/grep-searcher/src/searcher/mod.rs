///
/// Binary detection is the process of _heuristically_ identifying whether a
/// given chunk of data is binary or not, and then taking an action based on
/// the result of that heuristic. The motivation behind detecting binary data
/// is that binary data often indicates data that is undesirable to search
/// using textual patterns. Of course, there are many cases in which this isn't
/// true, which is why binary detection is disabled by default.
///
/// Unfortunately, binary detection works differently depending on the type of
/// search being executed:
///
/// 1. When performing a search using a fixed size buffer, binary detection is
///    applied to the buffer's contents as it is filled. Binary detection must
///    be applied to the buffer directly because binary files may not contain
///    line terminators, which could result in exorbitant memory usage.
/// 2. When performing a search using memory maps or by reading data off the
///    heap, then binary detection is only guaranteed to be applied to the
///    parts corresponding to a match. When `Quit` is enabled, then the first
///    few KB of the data are searched for binary data.
