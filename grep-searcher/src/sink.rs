/// A trait that defines how results from searchers are handled.
///
/// In this crate, a searcher follows the "push" model. What that means is that
/// the searcher drives execution, and pushes results back to the caller. This
/// is in contrast to a "pull" model where the caller drives execution and
/// takes results as they need them. These are also known as "internal" and
/// "external" iteration strategies, respectively.
///
/// For a variety of reasons, including the complexity of the searcher
/// implementation, this crate chooses the "push" or "internal" model of
/// execution. Thus, in order to act on search results, callers must provide
/// an implementation of this trait to a searcher, and the searcher is then
/// responsible for calling the methods on this trait.
///
/// This trait defines several behaviors:
///
/// * What to do when a match is found. Callers must provide this.
/// * What to do when an error occurs. Callers must provide this via the
///   [`SinkError`](trait.SinkError.html) trait. Generally, callers can just
///   use `io::Error` for this, which already implements `SinkError`.
/// * What to do when a contextual line is found. By default, these are
///   ignored.
/// * What to do when a gap between contextual lines has been found. By
///   default, this is ignored.
/// * What to do when a search has started. By default, this does nothing.
/// * What to do when a search has finished successfully. By default, this does
///   nothing.
///
/// Callers must, at minimum, specify the behavior when an error occurs and
/// the behavior when a match occurs. The rest is optional. For each behavior,
/// callers may report an error (say, if writing the result to another
/// location failed) or simply return `false` if they want the search to stop
/// (e.g., when implementing a cap on the number of search results to show).
///
/// When errors are reported (whether in the searcher or in the implementation
/// of `Sink`), then searchers quit immediately without calling `finish`.
///
/// For simpler uses of `Sink`, callers may elect to use one of
/// the more convenient but less flexible implementations in the
/// [`sinks`](sinks/index.html) module.
