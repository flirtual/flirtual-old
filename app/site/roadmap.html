    <h1>Product Roadmap</h1>
    <p>What should a VR Social Network look like? We think it should help people:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make new friends</li>
        <li>Strengthen existing friendships</li>
        <li>Socialize more</li>
        <li>Find and build community</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's our plan to make that happen.</p>

    <p>Your ROVR Profile helps you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Let people know your interests, hobbies, and background in VR and IRL</li>
        <li>Direct people to other accounts (i.e. Twitter, Discord, Steam, VRChat, etc.)</li>
        <li>See shared friends, personality traits, and groups</li>
    </ul>

    <p>ROVR is privacy-first. You can change or remove your profile information at any time, and change your visibility in your privacy settings.</p>

    <p>Your ROVR Guest List introduces you to people who share profile tags, interests, personality traits and mutual friends with you.</p>

    <p>As we refine the Guest List, we will reveal and explain its algorithm, which factors in common interests, mutual friends, personality traits, shared groups, and more.</p>

    <p>Community Groups help people find or create groups based on shared interests, activities, or existing communities and Discord servers.</p>

    <h2>Coming soon:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Events, which will let you create and join VR events in any VR app/game, see what your friends are up to, and find things to do together. This includes one-off events (like conferences), recurring events (like weekly clubs), LFG (for finding teammates), and spontaneous hangouts.</li>
        <li>Group matchmaking, to meet other people in a group setting, and to meet new people with your existing friends.</li>
        <li>A VRChat world and worlds in other Social VR apps.</li>
        <li>Public API for third-party integrations, so that you can more easily meet, message, and meet up with users across platforms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How will we make money?</h2>
    <p>Though ROVR is open-source and open-algorithm, we still need to make money in order to run our servers and feed our developers. We are committed to monetizing ROVR in user-respecting and user-aligned ways. Following the examples of Steam and Discord, we believe a sustainable business model will be a combination of customizations (like stickers, backgrounds, and custom emojis) and power-user features (like additional filters, boosts, and options).</p>

    <p>Let us know what you think through the feedback button, <a href="https://twitter.com/ROVRofficial" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, or our <a href="/discord" target="_blank">Discord server</a>.</p>
