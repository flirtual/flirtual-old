    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Back in 2018&mdash;at the height of the Ugandan Knuckles craze&mdash;kfarwell joined VRChat. He found out that people were dating in VR, but realized there was no VR dating site. So he made one. Now he's moved 2000 miles to live with his partner from VR. (It works!)</p>
    <p>Virtual Reality Looking-For-Partner (VRLFP) was the first VR dating site. We provided tens of thousands of matches to users all over the world, helping thousands of people meet in VR. With the new-and-improved Flirtual, we'll connect millions more VR users for dates, friendship, and everything in between.</p>
    <p>Why are we doing this? Because VR has changed our lives. Honestly. It's helped us come out of our shells, meet some of our best friends, survive quarantine sane, and fall in love.</p>
    <p>Yep. We really want this "metaverse" thing to go well, and help everyone find true connection and belonging, like VR has done for us. Everything we do&mdash;from Flirtual to projects like <a href="https://rovrapp.com/" target="_blank">ROVR</a> and <a href="https://homie.zone/" target="_blank">homie.zone</a>&mdash;is us trying to make that happen.</p>
    <p>So have fun! Be kind to each other. And don't forget to drink water.</p>
