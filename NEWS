Highlights of changes since rc-1.7. See ChangeLog for further details.

Portability. A fix to the autoconfiguration means that the nasty
longjmp() code is now omitted for all modern Unix systems; previously rc
only did the Right Thing on Linux. The test for large files in trip.rc
was removed, as this causes indigestion on file systems that don't
support sparse files (the configuration and implementation of large file
support is still present of course).

Bug fixes. Fix a use of uninitialized memory. Fix for CVE-2014-1936.
Broken symlinks now glob correctly.  The variables $prompt and $version
are now exported if they are inherited from the environment when rc
starts. EIO handling is now enabled for readline too. A few bogosities
in the history program were fixed. A regression introduced by the fix
for the $(a.b) quoting bug was fixed, and that bug was correctly fixed.

New features. Added $"x as a synonym for $^x. Minimal support for
various alternative line editing libraries. Filename completion with GNU
readline now quotes special characters.

Documentation. Licence updated to the zlib licence.
