// This module defines the set of command line arguments that ripgrep supports,
// including some light validation.
//
// This module is purposely written in a bare-bones way, since it is included
// in ripgrep's build.rs file as a way to generate a man page and completion
// files for common shells.
//
// The only other place that ripgrep deals with clap is in src/args.rs, which
// is where we read clap's configuration from the end user's arguments and turn
// it into a ripgrep-specific configuration type that is not coupled with clap.

const ABOUT: &str = "
ripgrep (rg) recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern.
By default, ripgrep will respect your .gitignore and automatically skip hidden
files/directories and binary files.

ripgrep's default regex engine uses finite automata and guarantees linear
time searching. Because of this, features like backreferences and arbitrary
look-around are not supported. However, if ripgrep is built with PCRE2, then
the --pcre2 flag can be used to enable backreferences and look-around.

ripgrep supports configuration files. Set RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH to a
configuration file. The file can specify one shell argument per line. Lines
starting with '#' are ignored. For more details, see the man page or the
README.

Tip: to disable all smart filtering and make ripgrep behave a bit more like
classical grep, use 'rg -uuu'.

When this flag is used, ripgrep will dynamically choose between supported regex
engines depending on the features used in a pattern. When ripgrep chooses a
regex engine, it applies that choice for every regex provided to ripgrep (e.g.,
via multiple -e/--regexp or -f/--file flags).

As an example of how this flag might behave, ripgrep will attempt to use
its default finite automata based regex engine whenever the pattern can be
successfully compiled with that regex engine. If PCRE2 is enabled and if the
pattern given could not be compiled with the default regex engine, then PCRE2
will be automatically used for searching. If PCRE2 isn't available, then this
flag has no effect because there is only one regex engine to choose from.

In the future, ripgrep may adjust its heuristics for how it decides which
regex engine to use. In general, the heuristics will be limited to a static
analysis of the patterns, and not to any specific runtime behavior observed
while searching files.

The primary downside of using this flag is that it may not always be obvious
which regex engine ripgrep uses, and thus, the match semantics or performance
profile of ripgrep may subtly and unexpectedly change. However, in many cases,
all regex engines will agree on what constitutes a match and it can be nice
to transparently support more advanced regex features like look-around and
backreferences without explicitly needing to enable them.

Enabling this flag will cause ripgrep to search binary files. By default,
ripgrep attempts to automatically skip binary files in order to improve the
relevance of results and make the search faster.

Binary files are heuristically detected based on whether they contain a NUL
byte or not. By default (without this flag set), once a NUL byte is seen,
ripgrep will stop searching the file. Usually, NUL bytes occur in the beginning
of most binary files. If a NUL byte occurs after a match, then ripgrep will
still stop searching the rest of the file, but a warning will be printed.

In contrast, when this flag is provided, ripgrep will continue searching a file
even if a NUL byte is found. In particular, if a NUL byte is found then ripgrep
will continue searching until either a match is found or the end of the file is
reached, whichever comes sooner. If a match is found, then ripgrep will stop
and print a warning saying that the search stopped prematurely.

If you want ripgrep to search a file without any special NUL byte handling at
all (and potentially print binary data to stdout), then you should use the
'-a/--text' flag.

The '--binary' flag is a flag for controlling ripgrep's automatic filtering
mechanism. As such, it does not need to be used when searching a file
explicitly or when searching stdin. That is, it is only applicable when
recursively searching a directory.

black. Styles are limited to nobold, bold, nointense, intense, nounderline
or underline.

The format of the flag is '{type}:{attribute}:{value}'. '{type}' should be
one of path, line, column or match. '{attribute}' can be fg, bg or style.
'{value}' is either a color (for fg and bg) or a text style. A special format,
'{type}:none', will clear all color settings for '{type}'.

For example, the following command will change the match color to magenta and
the background color for line numbers to yellow:

    rg --colors 'match:fg:magenta' --colors 'line:bg:yellow' foo.

Extended colors can be used for '{value}' when the terminal supports ANSI color
sequences. These are specified as either 'x' (256-color) or 'x,x,x' (24-bit
truecolor) where x is a number between 0 and 255 inclusive. x may be given as
a normal decimal number or a hexadecimal number, which is prefixed by `0x`.

For example, the following command will change the match background color to

    rg --colors 'match:bg:0,128,255'

**begin** - A message that indicates a file is being searched and contains at
least one match.

**end** - A message the indicates a file is done being searched. This message
also include summary statistics about the search for a particular file.

**match** - A message that indicates a match was found. This includes the text

**context** - A message that indicates a contextual line was found. This
includes the text of the line, along with any match information if the search
was inverted.

**summary** - The final message emitted by ripgrep that contains summary
statistics about the search across all files.

Since file paths or the contents of files are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8
and JSON itself must be representable by a Unicode encoding, ripgrep will emit
all data elements as objects with one of two keys: 'text' or 'bytes'. 'text' is
a normal JSON string when the data is valid UTF-8 while 'bytes' is the base64
encoded contents of the data.

fn flag_multiline(args: &mut Vec<RGArg>) {

Enable matching across multiple lines.

When multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction that a match
cannot include a line terminator. For example, when multiline mode is not
enabled (the default), then the regex '\\p{any}' will match any Unicode
codepoint other than '\\n'. Similarly, the regex '\\n' is explicitly forbidden,
and if you try to use it, ripgrep will return an error. However, when multiline
mode is enabled, '\\p{any}' will match any Unicode codepoint, including '\\n',
and regexes like '\\n' are permitted.

An important caveat is that multiline mode does not change the match semantics
of '.'. Namely, in most regex matchers, a '.' will by default match any
character other than '\\n', and this is true in ripgrep as well. In order to
make '.' match '\\n', you must enable the \"dot all\" flag inside the regex.
For example, both '(?s).' and '(?s:.)' have the same semantics, where '.' will
match any character, including '\\n'. Alternatively, the '--multiline-dotall'
flag may be passed to make the \"dot all\" behavior the default. This flag only
applies when multiline search is enabled.

There is no limit on the number of the lines that a single match can span.

**WARNING**: Because of how the underlying regex engine works, multiline
searches may be slower than normal line-oriented searches, and they may also
use more memory. In particular, when multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep
requires that each file it searches is laid out contiguously in memory
(either by reading it onto the heap or by memory-mapping it). Things that
cannot be memory-mapped (such as stdin) will be consumed until EOF before
searching can begin. In general, ripgrep will only do these things when
necessary. Specifically, if the --multiline flag is provided but the regex
does not contain patterns that would match '\\n' characters, then ripgrep
will automatically avoid reading each file into memory before searching it.
Nevertheless, if you only care about matches spanning at most one line, then it
is always better to disable multiline mode.

This flag can be disabled with --no-multiline.

typically isn't relevant for line-oriented matching (since matches can span at
most one line), this can be useful when searching with the -U/--multiline flag.
By default, the multiline mode runs without this flag.

This flag is generally intended to be used in an alias or your ripgrep config
file if you prefer \"dot all\" semantics by default. Note that regardless of
whether this flag is used, \"dot all\" semantics can still be controlled via
inline flags in the regex pattern itself, e.g., '(?s:.)' always enables \"dot

    const LONG: &str = long!("\
When PCRE2 matching is enabled, this flag will disable Unicode mode, which is
otherwise enabled by default. If PCRE2 matching is not enabled, then this flag
has no effect.

When PCRE2's Unicode mode is enabled, several different types of patterns
become Unicode aware. This includes '\\b', '\\B', '\\w', '\\W', '\\d', '\\D',
'\\s' and '\\S'. Similarly, the '.' meta character will match any Unicode
codepoint instead of any byte. Caseless matching will also use Unicode simple
case folding instead of ASCII-only case insensitivity.

Unicode mode in PCRE2 represents a critical trade off in the user experience
of ripgrep. In particular, unlike the default regex engine, PCRE2 does not
support the ability to search possibly invalid UTF-8 with Unicode features
enabled. Instead, PCRE2 *requires* that everything it searches when Unicode
mode is enabled is valid UTF-8. (Or valid UTF-16/UTF-32, but for the purposes
of ripgrep, we only discuss UTF-8.) This means that if you have PCRE2's Unicode
mode enabled and you attempt to search invalid UTF-8, then the search for that
file will halt and print an error. For this reason, when PCRE2's Unicode mode
is enabled, ripgrep will automatically \"fix\" invalid UTF-8 sequences by
replacing them with the Unicode replacement codepoint.

If you would rather see the encoding errors surfaced by PCRE2 when Unicode mode
is enabled, then pass the --no-encoding flag to disable all transcoding.

For each input FILE, search the standard output of COMMAND FILE rather than the
contents of FILE. This option expects the COMMAND program to either be an
absolute path or to be available in your PATH. Either an empty string COMMAND
or the '--no-pre' flag will disable this behavior.

    WARNING: When this flag is set, ripgrep will unconditionally spawn a
    process for every file that is searched. Therefore, this can incur an
    unnecessarily large performance penalty if you don't otherwise need the
    flexibility offered by this flag. One possible mitigation to this is to use
    the '--pre-glob' flag to limit which files a preprocessor is run with.

A preprocessor is not run when ripgrep is searching stdin.

When searching over sets of files that may require one of several decoders
as preprocessors, COMMAND should be a wrapper program or script which first
classifies FILE based on magic numbers/content or based on the FILE name and
then dispatches to an appropriate preprocessor. Each COMMAND also has its
standard input connected to FILE for convenience.

For example, a shell script for COMMAND might look like:

    case \"$1\" in
    *.pdf)
        exec pdftotext \"$1\" -
        ;;
    *)
        case $(file \"$1\") in
        *Zstandard*)
            exec pzstd -cdq
            ;;
        *)
            exec cat
            ;;
        esac
        ;;
    esac

The above script uses `pdftotext` to convert a PDF file to plain text. For
all other files, the script uses the `file` utility to sniff the type of the
file based on its contents. If it is a compressed file in the Zstandard format,
then `pzstd` is used to decompress the contents to stdout.

preprocessing. For example, given the following shell script, 'pre-pdftotext':
